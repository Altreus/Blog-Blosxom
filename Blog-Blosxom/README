Blog-Blosxom

This module is a rewrite of the blosxom cgi script found at www.blosxom.com.
It needed a rewrite so I did it.

See the POD of Blog::Blosxom for usage information and on writing plugins,
and the examples directory for example usage and plugin examples.

See also the POD for information on flavouring. Flavouring is the name the guy
who wrote Blosxom gave to the method of creating templates for different ways
of formatting the same blog data.

Please note that the prerequisites for the examples are not prerequisites for
the module and hence are not automatically installed by CPAN.

Unit tests will be ready before version 0.1.
